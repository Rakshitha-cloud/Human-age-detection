# Human-age-detection
Age detection is the process of automatically discerning the age of a person solely from a photo or video of their face.

#Abstract
The extraction of  data from various biometric approaches, including fingerprints, faces, iris, palms, voices, etc., is currently the subject of research. Gender, age, beard, scars, height, hair, skin tone, glasses, weight and other traits are all included in this data. Each piece of information acquires relevance during identification. One of the most important developments in facial recognition is the ability to determine a person's age and gender. Given the significance of age and gender in social interactions, it might be challenging to infer these two facial characteristics from a single-face photo. The term "computer vision" refers to the several terminologies used to scan images and determine an individual's age and gender. 

#Introduction
In this project, we leverage the capabilities of OpenCV, a potent computer vision library, to develop an automated system for detecting faces and estimating age and gender in a video stream. 
Utilizing a sophisticated face detection model, the system identifies facial features within each frame. Subsequently, pre-trained models for age and gender classification analyze the detected faces, providing insights into the likely demographic attributes of individuals. 
This project showcases the fusion of computer vision techniques and machine learning models to extract meaningful insights from visual data, contributing to the evolution of intelligent systems. 
Through a visual demonstration, we explore the code's intricacies, emphasizing its role in advancing facial analysis in the realm of computer vision.

#CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK
CNN, a sort of artificial neural network, is often used for categorizing and recognizing objects in images or pictures. Using a CNN, deep learning can identify items in an image. An input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer make up a conventional neural network. The structure of the human brain served as inspiration for CNN. Artificial neurons, also known as nodes, in CNNs, accept inputs, process them, and then provide the outcome as an output, much like a neuron in the brain does when sending information between cells. The images are used as a source of data. There may be numerous hidden layers in CNNâ€™s, and each one employs mathematics to extract features from the image. The layer at the bottom that divides features from inputs is the convolution layer.
